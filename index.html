                        Hello, My name is Devin. 
                        Generally speaking, I am a friendly and easy-going person.               
                        I really good at teamwork and I can also work well independently.               
                        I hope my classmate would agree I’m fun to study with.          
                    </p>
           
                    <p class="p2">             
                        I really fascinating by IT industry because when things go wrong or you fail at something in IT,             
                        you can take the feedback from those mistakes and be better equipped to tackle them the next time around.              
                        Using failure as a feedback, is an important skill both in IT and in life.             
                        For me, that’s why I was so attracted to It field.
